Check. \n\nSell your gig for as cheap as you can? Check. \n\nAdd in more services into your single gig without raising prices to outdo your competitor? Check.\n\nIf you can't see already, it's a [race to the bottom](https://seths.blog/2012/08/the-race-to-the-bottom/).\n\nFiverr doesnt let you price your gigs at less than $5. But if it did, I can bet there will be hundreds of people promising to do a mountain-worth of work for pennies. \n\nHeck, some would even do it for free if they could. Because they hope they'll land a bigger client if they get more experience, reviews, proof of work and customers. \n\nI know, because I had the same strategy: Price as low as you can, promise to do more than your competitor, wait until you get more reviews and a magical day would come when you'll raise prices and people will still buy.\n\nBut no, that's NOT how freelancing is done. \n\n1. **Pricing as low as you is bad for you, but worse for your clients.** You'll always have to pay your bills. Low prices demotivate you from doing your best work. If you dont value your work enough neither will you client, and quick tip: 90% of clients on Fiverr are looking for the cheapest, not the best. They somehow think an article written by someone who charges $70-100 will have the same quality as someone who charges $5. If you wanna be a great freelancer, value your work like it's important.\n2. ","lastmodified":"2023-04-24T06:18:33.969739333Z","tags":[]},"/notes/getting-real":{"title":"Notes from Getting Real by Basecamp","content":"\n**Don't build a company that follows competitors.** If they add 10 features, you don't need to add 20. Don't be defensive and paranoid. \n\n**What's your problem**. ==Great software solves your own problems, is born out of necessity and you care about it.== \n\n**Outside money is Plan B.** Investors slow down the process. Besides you don't need money anyways. Money constrains also force creativity and innovation. Which is a good thing.\n\n**Fix time and budget. If you can't deliver, lower the scope.** This helps you prioritise what really matters. If you fix all 3, what you deliver will have low levels of quality. \n\n\u003e ==It’s better to make half a product than a half-assed product==\n\n**Have a competitor and sell a different story.** Don't sell the story of faster performance when your enemy is doing the same, sell the story of a cheaper price. But generally, never sell the story of a cheaper price. ==Never compete on price.== That's a race to the bottom.\n\n\u003e **Have an enemy.** Sometimes the best way to know what your app should be is to know what it shouldn’t be. Figure out your app’s enemy and you’ll shine a light on where you need to go.\n\n**Flexibility (ie ability to quickly change and adapt) is key to building web businesses**. If you cannot adapt quickly, you'll be replaced by someone else who can. So, the less mass you've the better. \n\n\u003e **Mass is increased by…** \n\u003e - Long term contracts \n\u003e - Excess staff \n\u003e - Permanent decisions \n\u003e - Meetings about other meetings \n\u003e - Thick process \n\u003e - Inventory (physical or mental) \n\u003e - Hardware, software, technology lock-ins \n\u003e - Proprietary data formats \n\u003e - The past ruling the future \n\u003e - Long-term roadmaps \n\u003e - Office politics \n\u003e \n\u003e **Mass is reduced by…** \n\u003e - Just-in-time thinking \n\u003e - Multi-tasking team members \n\u003e - Embracing constraints, not trying to lift them \n\u003e - Less software, less code \n\u003e - Less features \n\u003e - Small team size \n\u003e - Simplicity \n\u003e - Pared-down interfaces \n\u003e - Open-source products \n\u003e - Open data formats \n\u003e - An open culture that makes it easy to admit mistakes\n\n**Lower your cost of change.** The more expensive it is to make a change, the less likely you’ll make it. And if your competitors can change faster than you, you’re at a huge disadvantage. ==If change gets too expensive, you’re dead==.\n\n**Being small isn't a weakness. It's a power. Don't act big.** Small companies are closer to customers by default. They've less bureaucracy. Less formalities. \n\n**What's the big idea behind your product?** ==Before you start building figure out your product's purpose and how it's different from what's out there.== It should be brief and should help you take decisions. \n\n**Ignore details early on.** \n\u003e Success and satisfaction are in the details. However, success isn’t the only thing you’ll find in the details. You’ll also find stagnation, disagreement, meetings, and delays. These things can kill morale and lower your chances of success. There’s plenty of time to be a perfectionist. Just do it later.\n\n\u003e **People often spend too much time up front trying to solve problems they don’t even have yet. Don’t.** Heck, we launched Basecamp without the ability to bill customers! Since the product billed in monthly cycles, we knew we had a 30-day gap to figure it out. We used that time to solve more urgent problems and then, after launch, we tackled billing. It worked out fine (and it forced us into a simple solution without unnecessary bells and whistles)\n\n## On Selecting Features\n\n**Start with \"No\" to every feature idea.** For every new feature you need to…\n1. Say no.\n2. Force the feature to prove its value.\n3. If “no” again, end here. If “yes,” continue…\n4. Sketch the screen(s)/ui.\n5. Design the screen(s)/ui.\n6. Code it.\n7. – 15. Test, tweak, test, tweak, test, tweak, test, tweak…\n8. Check to see if help text needs to be modified.\n9. Update the product tour (if necessary).\n10. Update the marketing copy (if necessary).\n11. Update the terms of service (if necessary).\n12. Check to see if any promises were broken.\n13. Check to see if pricing structure is affected.\n14. Launch.\n15. Hold breath.\n\n\u003e Each time you say yes to a feature, you’re adopting a child. You have to take your baby through a whole chain of events (e.g. design, implementation, testing, etc.). And once that feature’s out there, you’re stuck with it. Just try to take a released feature away from customers and see how pissed off they get.\n\n\u003e ==Innovation is not about saying yes to everything. It’s about saying NO to all but the most crucial features.== ~ Derek Siver\n\n**Ask your customers what they don't want.** If you could/have to remove one feature, what'd it be? What gets in your way the most?\n\u003e **Innovation comes from saying no to 1,000 things** to make sure we don’t get on the wrong track or try to do too much. We’re always thinking about new markets we could enter, but it’s only by saying no that you can concentrate on the things that are really important. ~ Steve Jobs\n\n## On Processes\n\n**Get something real up and running quickly.** It builds up momentum, and flushes out unimportant ideas. This should be your number one priority from day one. Skip details, take shortcuts but just get there. Because once you do you'll get a much better perspective on how to proceed. Real things cause agreement in teams that may disagree while planning the prototype.\n\n**Basecamp's process from idea to implementation**\n1. Come up with ideas. What is this product going to do? ... This stage is not about nitty gritty details. This is about big questions. ==What does the app need to do? How will we know when it’s useful? What exactly are we going to make?== This is about high level ideas, not pixel-level discussions. At this stage, those kinds of details just aren’t meaningful.\n2. Draw paper sketches. Nothing gets more cheaper or faster. Just get the idea from your head onto a paper.\n3. Create HTML screens. No hard coding required. Just use HTML and CSS build out interfaces and make something that looks real.\n4. Code it out. Stay flexible and expect iterations. \n\nYou can throw deliverables from away any steps anytime and start again. Expect this to happen.\n\n**Don't let customers choose.** It's your job. Your decisions are always undo-able.\n\n**Embrace \"I don't know.\"** Don't cook up things to sound smart. No one can now the exact answer to an unknowable question.\n\n**Set up a rule. No meeting people for half the day.** People are most productive when they're alone. Creatives need to have alone time to get work done. Schedule all meetings and messages for the end of the day.\n\n**Do 4hr quick wins to have a reason to celebrate every week.** This could be things like working on a little documentation that reduces support burden a little. \n\n## On Hiring\n\n**Take a test drive before hiring.** Make them work on a project and see how they work, communicate, act. Better the resumes and other proof of work. \n\n**Prefer Generalists over Specialists for small teams.** Small teams need people who can wear a lot of hats. You can't afford a specialist who has a very narrowly defined skillset.\n\n**Hire happy and average over frustrated and great.** No one can fake enthusiasm. Hiring people who interested in solving the problem. Who asks a lot of questions and gives you ideas.\n \n **If you are trying to decide between a few people to fill a position, always hire the better writer.**\n\n ## On Designing Interfaces\n\n **Epicentre first, extras second.** ==Design the most important element of a page first.== Then go to the second most imp and so on. Don't start designing a blog post page with the nav bar. \n\n **Design for the regular, blank and error state.**\n - **Regular**: The screen people see when everything’s working fine and your app is flush with data.\n-   **Blank**: The screen people see when using the app for the first time, before data is entered. This is what people see and decide if they want to use your software. Without the data, it might look empty and useless.\n\u003e Another aspect of the Mac OS x ui that I think has been tremendously influenced by Steve Jobs is the setup and first-run experience. I think Jobs is keenly aware of the importance of first impressions…I think ==Jobs looks at the first-run experience and thinks, it may only be one-thousandth of a user’s overall experience with the machine, but it’s the most important onethousandth==, because it’s the first one-thousandth, and it sets their expectations and initial impression.\n\u003e \n\u003e —[John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/), author and web developer (from [Interview with John Gruber](http://www.guidebookgallery.org/articles/interviewwithjohngruber)\n- **Error**: The screen people see when something goes wrong. Because they will. \"If you abandon customers in their time of need, they’re unlikely to forget it.\" \n\n**Context over Consistency.** It’s ok to be inconsistent if your design makes more sense that way. Give people just what matters. ==Give them what they need when they need it and get rid of what they don’t. It’s better to be right than to be consistent==\n\n**Build less software: Less features, less code, less waste.** More code leads to exponentially more complexities. \n- Don’t be afraid to say no to feature requests that are hard to do. Unless they’re absolutely essential, save time/effort/confusion by leaving them out.\n- Don’t take action on an idea for a week and see if it still seems like a great idea after the initial buzz wears off.\n\n**Don't do dead docs.** It gets in the way. It disturbs the flow. Nobody reads it.\n\n**Don't use Lorem Ipsum.** Dummy texts don't give a good idea. Use real words. What your customers will see in there. \n\n**Choose your product's personality.** And stick with it everywhere. Think of your product as a person. What type of person do you want it to be? Polite? Stern? Forgiving? Strict? Funny? Deadpan? Serious? Loose? Do you want to come off as paranoid or trusting? As a know-it-all? Or modest and likable?\n\n**Always have some part of your product available for free.** To get attention in this world. To make people experience before they buy it.\n\n**What to have on your promo site for the product?**\nOverview: Explain your app and its benefits.\nTour: Guide people through various features.\nScreen captures and videos: Show people what the app actually looks like and how to use it.\nManifesto: Explain the philosophy and ideas behind it.\nCase Studies: Provide real life examples that show what’s possible.\nBuzz: Testimonial quotes from customers, reviews, press, etc.\nForum: Offer a place for members of the community to help one another.\nPricing \u0026 Sign-up: Get people into your app as quickly as possible.\nWeblog: Blogs keep your site fresh with news, tips, etc.\n\n**Keep track of who's talking about you.** Who's linking to you, who's bitching about you. Give them early access. VIP invites. Get feedback. \n\n**Promote your plans inside the app.** Don't restrict promotion of your plans to your marketing site. Add prompts to your app everywhere there's a limit. \n\n**Customers are not always right.** Feel free to say NO to feedbacks. If you say yes to everything your customer demands, they'll find it too complex to use anyways. They don't know what they want.\n\n**Publicise your screwups.** However small they maybe. Be honest with your customers. An informed customer is the best customer. \n\n**Do a big update 30 days after launch.** It shows you're here to stay, that you've more tricks up your sleeve. And it keeps the excitement up.\n\n**Keep a product blog up and running** with tips, how-tos, FAQs, news and updates. It shows your product isn't abandoned. \n\n**Public betas are an excuse.** They're like saying \"it's not ready, so if it doesn't work don't blame us.\" But that's not right, just don't release it until it's ready for the public. And then don't wait for perfection, call it a release and solve bugs that come.\n\n**Prioritize your bugs.** How many people are affected? How bad is the problem? Does this bug deserve immediate attention or can it wait? What can you do right now that will have the greatest impact for the greatest number of people? Often times adding a new feature may even be more important to your app than fixing an existing bug.\n\n**When you'll release a new change, the negative voices will be louder than the positive ones.** But that doesn't mean your change is bad. Stay calm and wait. \n\n**Resist bloat.** As your software matures, don't make it bloated or unnecessarily complicated.

Start early.** For HelloMeets, articles took about a month before starting to show any traffic. But within a month, you’d know if something’s wrong. If you’ve done point #1 right, you’ll be internally sure you’re gonna rank, sooner or later. So just keep pushing. Often it takes a lot of tweaking titles and restructuring to make a page rank.

Don't care what people think. Especially when you're scared.\n\n**Limit in your information input.** Don't listen to everyone always. Divide things between what's urgent and important. You'll find many urgent-but-unimportant and many important-but-not-urgent things.\n\n**Empty your mind.** \"It's impossible to hit and think at the same time\" Remove all negative AND positive thoughts when you're performing. Don't think \"shit I suck\", but also don't think \"wow that was easy\".\n\n**Slow down, think deeply.** Essential things are invisible to they eye until you stand still and observe them. When you don't, you attribute others behaviours to wrong reasons and make bad decisions. \n\n**Start Journaling.** At the end of the day, review your behaviour. Weigh up the right and the wrongs. Ask yourself tough questions like where am i exactly standing? what's a small step today for big impact in the future? \n\n**Turn down the volume around you** and access a deeper awareness of what is actually going around you. Cultivate moments of silence in your schedule and be fully present.\n\n**Seek wisdom and not the status of being wise.** Ask question. Study and reflect. ^^Be intellectually humble.^^ Learn from mistakes. Get a sense of the big picture. Find people you admire, ask how they got there, seek book recommendations, experiment. Familiarise yourself with the unfamiliar. Widen your perspective.\n\n\u003e [[Socrates]] was so wise because he knew only one thing that he wasn't and was always willing to be proven wrong.\n\n**Have confidence, but avoid ego.** Confidence scares off enemies. Ego creates enemies. Be at peace in difficulty. ^^Have an honest understanding of your strengths and weaknesses.^^\n\n**Let Go.** Detach from the idea of outcomes when doing something do it purposelessly. Rather spend energy developing your form, not waste it on getting the outcome. Get lost in the process.\n- [[Learning by detaching from the outcome]]\n- Seth Godin talks about this in [[The Practice]] For example, for Bluff, detach from the outcome (correctly predicting or not), don't let that affect you. Instead focus on the sole practice of thinking of what to do.\n\n## Stillness of the Soul\n-   **Choose Virtue.** Your choices have meaning. Virtues are guiding principles for all these choices. Having virtues gives you the calmness of knowing whats right and what's wrong. They save your from arguing over each decision and considering every action.\n\t-   What do we stand for? What do we believe to be essential and important? What are we really living for? What’s important to me? What would I rather die for than betray? How am I going to live and why?\n-   **Heal the inner child.** Many adults still deal from the poor environment or parent conditions. Break this cycle. Give more. Give what you didn't have. Love more. Drop the old story.\n\t-   The environment we have at childhood affects us as an adult probably more than anything else. Childhood especially because that's the time when we can't do anything on your own so our environment shapes us the most.\n\t-   These natural reactions that originate from our childhood start a #[[Decision Flow]] that flows down to us reacting in a certain way.\n-   **Don't fall prey to desire.** Desires leave us unable to think clearly. Lust for anything is a destroyer of peace. You actually don't feel pleasure after achieving the desire. Real pleasure is in being free of desires. Virtues also help you be desire-free.\n-   **Enough.** Having enough is no more wanting, no more insecurity of comparison. It's about satisfaction from the lack of desires. When you've enough, you do things not to achieve a goal or make progress. Your motivations are pure.\n-   **Bathe in beauty.** Go outside. Observe the beauty. Step outside your self. Find beauty and satisfaction in nature.\n-   Domain of the body\n-   **Build a routine.** Complete freedom is a nightmare. Freedom just gives opportunity to build routines and orders that result in excellence. So just reduce how many choices you've to make.\n-   **Get rid of your stuff.** The more stuff you own the less free you're. You've to worry about if someone steals or breaks it. You've to stress yourself to earn extra. Question why you own what you own.","lastmodified":"2023-04-24T06:18:33.969739333Z","tags":[]},"/notes/thanks":{"title":"thanks","content":"All lot of people have helped me throughout my life.
