Here's a running log of everything I did and everything that happened to me in 2022:

# January
- I was fine in the morning but by night, I had fever. At worst, 103˚F. But I'm fine now. Not omicron.
- Days after thinking it wasn't omicron, dad got tested positive and so did I. Had to stay in a 2-week quarantine and missed going out a lot.

## March
- Ended salary negotiations from work. Proposed a ₹2k/article (divided into 4 parts of work). Monthly pay will remain under 10k, because my work is less: I barely get 2 articles published in a month. Although best part, it's in my control, I can choose to take on more work and thus increase my pay.
- Socialscribe has done $68.55 until now, though i hate that I'll get the amount after April/May. (Thanks to AppSumo's refund period.)
- Got my whiteboard delivered and it's great to have one in my room again. I had it as a kid and loved it. I write exam syllabus and socialscribe marketing ideas on it.
- A lot of my head space went into ideating plans for socialscribe.
