SEO. or Search Engine Optimisation.

In 2019, I made my first crappy blog published a few posts. Looking at low traffic, I started finding ways to grow it. That’s when I fell into the SEO rabbit hole. And boy was it deep. I spent like an year reading and watching everything I could find on the topic. ^577d90

But I had almost nothing to practice these skills on. I started another blog for free on wordpress.com which I named [theciva](https://theciva.wordpress.com/) .

Some of my articles started ranking but to no use, that’s when I learnt:

- if ranking is easy, the keyword most likely has little to no traffic
- the key to keyword research is finding a topic that’s easy/moderate to rank for (based on your website’s authority) and that has decent traffic.


Fast forward a few months and I was doing [$5 Fiverr gigs](/freelancing) for a month which sucked. Fast forward a few more months, I pitched to [Sahiba Sethi](https://twitter.com/sahibasethi7) and [joined in at HelloMeets](/freelancing) in August. (And by November I helped get them to 7k+.)

My real seo practice started at HelloMeets.

Here’s the list of all seo insights I’ve learnt through practice.

1. **The key to getting good traffic is keyword research.** It doesn’t have to complicated or lengthy. But a professional tool makes it a lot better (I use [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/)). Your target is to find topics you can write about, that you can rank in the top 5 for, that can get you good traffic if you’re in the top 5, and finally has some business potential for your company.
2. **SEO takes time. Start early.** For HelloMeets, articles took about a month before starting to show any traffic. But within a month, you’d know if something’s wrong. If you’ve done point #1 right, you’ll be internally sure you’re gonna rank, sooner or later. So just keep pushing. Often it takes a lot of tweaking titles and restructuring to make a page rank. Nail point #1, and just keep pushing.
