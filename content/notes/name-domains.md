title: "name-domains"
---

From quite a few years, I've had a fascination for domains that read like proper sentences. At 13-14, I thought of making a platform for people to debate on various topics. Anyone could log in and create their profile which would be hosted at goagainst.me/i'm/their-name and specific topics pages would be hosted at goagainst.me/on/topic 

That's pretty much all I thought about the platform, it never lived ofcourse. But my fascination for domain names did.

And when I was trying to find a cheap, good looking name for [[socialscribe]], I ended up choosing [socialscri.be](https://socialscri.be/) over socialscribe.co.
