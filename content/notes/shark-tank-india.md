observations I couldn't resist sharing as I'm watching [Shark Tank India](https://www.sonyliv.com/shows/shark-tank-india-1700000741)


1/ **this guy gave away 50% equity for â‚¹40 lacs (~$53k)**

his bike rental service isn't profitable & he wants money to stick through the dip until it starts earning enough to sustain on itself.

but Ashneer Grover [^1], the shark, doesn't believe in his vision. He dreams of making the service cheaper and earning their real revenue with the data of who-goes-where-and-when which their service can easily collect.

Could their expectations be more different?

worse still:

the guy lost control over his startup and now has to work on somebody else's idea which he doesn't look passionate about.


2/ **"Aaj aapke pass koi bhi business nhi hai bs ek idea aur ek concept hai. hm aapke uppar paisa lga rhe hai ..."**

Sharks say this a lot, especially right after they've offered seemingly little money for a large chunk of equity. 


3/ **first movers advantage is something a lot of entrepreneurs in the show count on as their defence against competition.**

Sharks often ask "what if the big guys (Byju's, Myntra etc) copy?" and a lot of founders don't seem to have a clear answer.
