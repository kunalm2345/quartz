I'll probably be up for doing what you want me to if it's:
- about something I care for
- I believe in your idea
- not boring or managerial work
- if the people I'll work along with are amazing

Also, if I've time (Can't control this one, I've to deal with classes and exams.)

In any case, [let me know](/lmk). ;)

*for my thoughts on freelancing instead, [head over here](/freelancing).*
