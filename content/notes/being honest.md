# being honest

one i think i like a lot about disha is the fact that she's honest. very honest.

we usually dont tell people things that're bad. but she does. kinda instinctively.

one such situation comes to mind:

Ravi uncle told us to taste the food at a party and said batana kaisa hai. 

i usually instinctively say aacha hai to things that i don't like too, but she found it weird when i said namak kam hai she said i should tell it to uncle.


im def over analysing.
