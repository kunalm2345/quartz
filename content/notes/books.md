I'm one of those people who read a lot of book at once. I usually start our many and stop when I don't feel inspired anymore and then sometimes continue on the ones I stopped.

Right now, I'm reading: 

- **Freakonomics.** Ankur Warikoo recommended this on a video and the text on the cover feels very intriguing. I didn't expect I'd find it anywhere locally (I live in a tier 3-4 city) but found it in a small corner book store.
- **Range.** This feels like the best book I've read. I've always seen myself as a Generalist, even before I knew the word for it. Two chapters in, I can say Range is as insightful as *Zero to One*. 
- **Why Men Don't Understand And Women Can't Read Maps.** 

Previously read:

- **Getting Real.** A very practical and unconventional way to building web apps. By the Basecamp founders. ([Here's my summary](/getting-real))
- **Stillness is the Key.** Ryan Holiday's ([Here's my summary](/stillness-is-the-key))
