title: "notes on this site's design"
---

this site is a work in progress. i'm trying to design it so that it represets who I am. it's like you're talking to me. except it's just me speaking. the homepage tries to list out all the broad areas I'm interested in and projects I'm working on without actually creating a list and then the link take you to things we'll have in common.
