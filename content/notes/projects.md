I believe in diving my life into areas and projects. Areas are things I'm interested in but they don't have a defined goal and time frame. Projects, which are way more special, have a goal, time frame and ending defined already.

This page lists all of my projects.

## Now
- **JEE Prep.** I'm preparing to give the exam in 2023. My dream college would be IITs (of course) and BITS (also, of course). I'm doing an classroom course from Aakash at my local centre.
- **SEO Analyst Intern @ [HelloMeets](/hellomeets)** My first internship. Super exciting. I've spent a lot of time in 2018/19 learning SEO and this is how I can practice my skills. [(more on this story here).](/seo) 5 months after I joined, the traffic on the blog is on an all-time-high at 8k (it was barely even 1k when i joined ;).
- **Twift.** A side project/micro-SaaS I'm building which lets people boost their engagement and reach through running mass giveaways on Twitter. [(More on this here.)](/twift)
- **[Back of my Head](/bomh)** is my curation newsletter where I share interesting links I find, every week. It's also my best newsletter so far and a lot of people love it. It's currently at ~100 subscribers but growing slowly. [Subscribe or read prev issues here.](http://bit.ly/getbomh)

## Past
(i keep updating this list as i remember other cool (and stupid) things i did back in the day but for now it lists the highlights).

### 2021
my best year yet, I got super lucky and a lot of good things happened to me. 
- **Templates for The Morning Context.** Long story but here's the tldr: Someone on Twitter complained how badly designed [The Morning Context](https://themorningcontext.com)'s infographics look and I took a few hours off of my boring classes to try out something fun and made them an infographic template. They kinda liked it and offered to buy it from me. I got on a call with Harveen Ahluwalia[^1]. And the amount was sent. That was the biggest I had earnt from a single freelance project and it gave me the push I needed to [stop competiting for $5 gigs on Fiverr](/freelancing).


[^1]: Harveen, if you're reading this, thanks for handling the childish me who had no clue about anything and just naively (and desparately lol) wanted to work with The Morning Context. Haha. :)
