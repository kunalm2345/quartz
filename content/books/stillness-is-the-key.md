## Stillness of the Mind
**Be present and focused.** Ruminating about the past or worrying about the future affects your performance the most. Don't care what people think. Especially when you're scared.

**Limit in your information input.** Don't listen to everyone always. Divide things between what's urgent and important. You'll find many urgent-but-unimportant and many important-but-not-urgent things.

**Empty your mind.** "It's impossible to hit and think at the same time" Remove all negative AND positive thoughts when you're performing. Don't think "shit I suck", but also don't think "wow that was easy".

**Slow down, think deeply.** Essential things are invisible to they eye until you stand still and observe them. When you don't, you attribute others behaviours to wrong reasons and make bad decisions. 

**Start Journaling.** At the end of the day, review your behaviour. Weigh up the right and the wrongs. Ask yourself tough questions like where am i exactly standing? what's a small step today for big impact in the future? 

**Turn down the volume around you** and access a deeper awareness of what is actually going around you. Cultivate moments of silence in your schedule and be fully present.

**Seek wisdom and not the status of being wise.** Ask question. Study and reflect. ^^Be intellectually humble.^^ Learn from mistakes. Get a sense of the big picture. Find people you admire, ask how they got there, seek book recommendations, experiment. Familiarise yourself with the unfamiliar. Widen your perspective.

> [[Socrates]] was so wise because he knew only one thing that he wasn't and was always willing to be proven wrong.

**Have confidence, but avoid ego.** Confidence scares off enemies. Ego creates enemies. Be at peace in difficulty. ^^Have an honest understanding of your strengths and weaknesses.^^

**Let Go.** Detach from the idea of outcomes when doing something do it purposelessly. Rather spend energy developing your form, not waste it on getting the outcome. Get lost in the process.
- [[Learning by detaching from the outcome]]
- Seth Godin talks about this in [[The Practice]] For example, for Bluff, detach from the outcome (correctly predicting or not), don't let that affect you. Instead focus on the sole practice of thinking of what to do.

## Stillness of the Soul
-   **Choose Virtue.** Your choices have meaning. Virtues are guiding principles for all these choices. Having virtues gives you the calmness of knowing whats right and what's wrong. They save your from arguing over each decision and considering every action.
	-   What do we stand for? What do we believe to be essential and important? What are we really living for? What’s important to me? What would I rather die for than betray? How am I going to live and why?
-   **Heal the inner child.** Many adults still deal from the poor environment or parent conditions. Break this cycle. Give more. Give what you didn't have. Love more. Drop the old story.
	-   The environment we have at childhood affects us as an adult probably more than anything else. Childhood especially because that's the time when we can't do anything on your own so our environment shapes us the most.
	-   These natural reactions that originate from our childhood start a #[[Decision Flow]] that flows down to us reacting in a certain way.
-   **Don't fall prey to desire.** Desires leave us unable to think clearly. Lust for anything is a destroyer of peace. You actually don't feel pleasure after achieving the desire. Real pleasure is in being free of desires. Virtues also help you be desire-free.
-   **Enough.** Having enough is no more wanting, no more insecurity of comparison. It's about satisfaction from the lack of desires. When you've enough, you do things not to achieve a goal or make progress. Your motivations are pure.
-   **Bathe in beauty.** Go outside. Observe the beauty. Step outside your self. Find beauty and satisfaction in nature.
-   Domain of the body
-   **Build a routine.** Complete freedom is a nightmare. Freedom just gives opportunity to build routines and orders that result in excellence. So just reduce how many choices you've to make.
-   **Get rid of your stuff.** The more stuff you own the less free you're. You've to worry about if someone steals or breaks it. You've to stress yourself to earn extra. Question why you own what you own.
