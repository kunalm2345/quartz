we usually dont tell people things that&amp;rsquo;re bad. but she does. kinda instinctively.
one such situation comes to mind:
Ravi uncle told us to taste the food at a party and said batana kaisa hai.
i usually instinctively say aacha hai to things that i don&amp;rsquo;t like too, but she found it weird when i said namak kam hai she said i should tell it to uncle.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://kunal.tech/seo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kunal.tech/seo/</guid><description>SEO. or Search Engine Optimisation.
In 2019, I made my first crappy blog published a few posts. Looking at low traffic, I started finding ways to grow it. Thatâ€™s when I fell into the SEO rabbit hole. And boy was it deep. I spent like an year reading and watching everything I could find on the topic.
But I had almost nothing to practice these skills on. I started another blog for free on wordpress.</description></item><item><title>2022</title><link>https://kunal.tech/2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kunal.tech/2022/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a running log of everything I did and everything that happened to me in 2022:
January I was fine in the morning but by night, I had fever. At worst, 103ËšF. But I&amp;rsquo;m fine now. Not omicron. Days after thinking it wasn&amp;rsquo;t omicron, dad got tested positive and so did I. Had to stay in a 2-week quarantine and missed going out a lot. b</description></item><item><title>Back of my Head</title><link>https://kunal.tech/bomh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kunal.tech/bomh/</guid><description/></item><item><title>freelancing</title><link>https://kunal.tech/freelancing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kunal.tech/freelancing/</guid><description>For most of you, freelancing on Fiverr (or any other freelance platform) isn&amp;rsquo;t worth it.
When I got started on Fiverr, I looked around and imitated what others did.

Sell your gig for as cheap as you can? Check.

I usually start our many and stop when I don&amp;rsquo;t feel inspired anymore and then sometimes continue on the ones I stopped.
Right now, I&amp;rsquo;m reading:
Freakonomics. Ankur Warikoo recommended this on a video and the text on the cover feels very intriguing. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect I&amp;rsquo;d find it anywhere locally (I live in a tier 3-4 city) but found it in a small corner book store.</description></item><item><title>Let me know</title><link>https://kunal.tech/lmk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kunal.tech/lmk/</guid><description>If there&amp;rsquo;s anything I should know, you can just shoot me an email at hey@kunal.tech or DM me on Twitter .</description></item><item><title>Notes from Getting Real by Basecamp</title><link>https://kunal.tech/getting-real/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kunal.tech/getting-real/</guid><description>Don&amp;rsquo;t build a company that follows competitors. If they add 10 features, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to add 20. Don&amp;rsquo;t be defensive and paranoid.
What&amp;rsquo;s your problem. ==Great software solves your own problems, is born out of necessity and you care about it.==
Outside money is Plan B. Investors slow down the process. Besides you don&amp;rsquo;t need money anyways. Money constrains also force creativity and innovation. Which is a good thing.</description></item><item><title>Notes from Range: How Generalists Triumph in a World of Specialists</title><link>https://kunal.tech/range/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kunal.tech/range/</guid><description>Specialise Later. Spend your early days exploring, not exploiting.
Experience breeds skills only in kind learning environments. Kind learning environments are like chess. Rules are clearly defined, feedback is quick and correct, and patterns repeat. But most of our world is a wicked learning environment, where patterns don&amp;rsquo;t repeat, where experience breeds confidence but not skill. A deadly combination.
Computers replace the need for years of deliberate practice. Centaur is a chess team comprised of humans taking big-picture strategy decisions and computers doing the hard calculations and pattern matching.</description></item><item><title>notes from Shark Tank India's ðŸ˜¬ moments</title><link>https://kunal.tech/shark-tank-india/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kunal.tech/shark-tank-india/</guid><description>observations I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist sharing as I&amp;rsquo;m watching Shark Tank India 1/ this guy gave away 50% equity for â‚¹40 lacs (~$53k)
his bike rental service isn&amp;rsquo;t profitable &amp;amp; he wants money to stick through the dip until it starts earning enough to sustain on itself.
but Ashneer Grover 1, the shark, doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe in his vision. He dreams of making the service cheaper and earning their real revenue with the data of who-goes-where-and-when which their service can easily collect.</description></item><item><title>Notes from Stillness is the Key by Ryan Holiday</title><link>https://kunal.tech/stillness-is-the-key/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kunal.tech/stillness-is-the-key/</guid><description>Stillness of the Mind Be present and focused. Ruminating about the past or worrying about the future affects your performance the most. Don&amp;rsquo;t care what people think. Especially when you&amp;rsquo;re scared.
Limit in your information input. Don&amp;rsquo;t listen to everyone always. Divide things between what&amp;rsquo;s urgent and important. You&amp;rsquo;ll find many urgent-but-unimportant and many important-but-not-urgent things.
Empty your mind. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to hit and think at the same time&amp;rdquo; Remove all negative AND positive thoughts when you&amp;rsquo;re performing.</description></item><item><title>notes on this site's design</title><link>https://kunal.tech/meta/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kunal.tech/meta/</guid><description>this site is a work in progress. i&amp;rsquo;m trying to design it so that it represets who I am. it&amp;rsquo;s like you&amp;rsquo;re talking to me. except it&amp;rsquo;s just me speaking. the homepage tries to list out all the broad areas I&amp;rsquo;m interested in and projects I&amp;rsquo;m working on without actually creating a list and then the link take you to things we&amp;rsquo;ll have in common.</description></item><item><title>Projects</title><link>https://kunal.tech/projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kunal.tech/projects/</guid><description>I believe in diving my life into areas and projects. Areas are things I&amp;rsquo;m interested in but they don&amp;rsquo;t have a defined goal and time frame. Projects, which are way more special, have a goal, time frame and ending defined already.
This page lists all of my projects.
Now JEE Prep. I&amp;rsquo;m preparing to give the exam in 2023. My dream college would be IITs (of course) and BITS (also, of course).</description></item><item><title>Socialscribe</title><link>https://kunal.tech/socialscribe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kunal.tech/socialscribe/</guid><description/></item><item><title>thanks</title><link>https://kunal.tech/thanks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kunal.tech/thanks/</guid><description>All lot of people have helped me throughout my life.

This is known to get way more engagement and traffic.</description></item></channel></rss>
