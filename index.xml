January I was fine in the morning but by night, I had fever. At worst, 103ËšF. But I&amp;rsquo;m fine now. Not omicron.</description></item><item><title>Back of my Head</title><link>https://kunal.tech/bomh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kunal.tech/bomh/</guid><description/></item><item><title>freelancing</title><link>https://kunal.tech/freelancing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kunal.tech/freelancing/</guid><description>For most of you, freelancing on Fiverr (or any other freelance platform) isn&amp;rsquo;t worth it.
When I got started on Fiverr, I looked around and imitated what others did.
Put in big adjectives in your titles? Check.
Sell your gig for as cheap as you can? Check.
Add in more services into your single gig without raising prices to outdo your competitor? Check.
If you can&amp;rsquo;t see already, it&amp;rsquo;s a race to the bottom .</description></item><item><title>hire Kunal Mishra</title><link>https://kunal.tech/hire/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kunal.tech/hire/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ll probably be up for doing what you want me to if it&amp;rsquo;s:

If they add 10 features, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to add 20. Don&amp;rsquo;t be defensive and paranoid.
What&amp;rsquo;s your problem. ==Great software solves your own problems, is born out of necessity and you care about it.==
Outside money is Plan B. Investors slow down the process. Besides you don&amp;rsquo;t need money anyways. Money constrains also force creativity and innovation. Which is a good thing.</description></item><item><title>notes from Shark Tank India's ðŸ˜¬ moments</title><link>https://kunal.tech/shark-tank-india/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kunal.tech/shark-tank-india/</guid><description>observations I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist sharing as I&amp;rsquo;m watching Shark Tank India 1/ this guy gave away 50% equity for â‚¹40 lacs (~$53k)
his bike rental service isn&amp;rsquo;t profitable &amp;amp; he wants money to stick through the dip until it starts earning enough to sustain on itself.
but Ashneer Grover 1, the shark, doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe in his vision. He dreams of making the service cheaper and earning their real revenue with the data of who-goes-where-and-when which their service can easily collect.</description></item><item><title>Projects</title><link>https://kunal.tech/projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kunal.tech/projects/</guid><description>I believe in diving my life into areas and projects. Areas are things I&amp;rsquo;m interested in but they don&amp;rsquo;t have a defined goal and time frame. Projects, which are way more special, have a goal, time frame and ending defined already.
This page lists all of my projects.
Now JEE Prep. I&amp;rsquo;m preparing to give the exam in 2023. My dream college would be IITs (of course) and BITS (also, of course).</description></item><item><title>SEO Insights I've Learnt Through Practice</title><link>https://kunal.tech/seo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kunal.tech/seo/</guid><description>In 2019, I made my first crappy blog published a few posts. Looking at low traffic, I started finding ways to grow it. That&amp;rsquo;s when I fell into the SEO rabbit hole. And boy was it deep. I spent like an year reading and watching everything I could find on the topic.
But I had almost nothing to practice these skills on. I started another blog for free on wordpress.com which I named theciva .</description></item><item><title>thanks</title><link>https://kunal.tech/thanks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kunal.tech/thanks/</guid><description>All lot of people have helped me throughout my life.

If you&amp;rsquo;ve made a new info product, instead of just tweeting out it&amp;rsquo;s link, you can create some artificial scarcity and tweet out &amp;ldquo;i made this. if you want it, just reply with a ðŸ‘‹ and i&amp;rsquo;ll personally DM it to you.&amp;rdquo;
This is known to get way more engagement and traffic.</description></item></channel></rss>
