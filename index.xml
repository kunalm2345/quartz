When I got started on Fiverr, I looked around and imitated what others did.
Put in big adjectives in your titles? Check.
Sell your gig for as cheap as you can? Check.
Add in more services into your single gig without raising prices to outdo your competitor? Check.
If you can&amp;rsquo;t see already, it&amp;rsquo;s a race to the bottom.</description></item><item><title>hire Kunal Mishra</title><link>https://kunalm2345.github.io/quartz/hire/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kunalm2345.github.io/quartz/hire/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ll probably be up for doing what you want me to if it&amp;rsquo;s:

In 2019, I made my first crappy blog published a few posts. Looking at low traffic, I started finding ways to grow it. That&amp;rsquo;s when I fell into the SEO rabbit hole. And boy was it deep. I spent like an year reading and watching everything I could find on the topic.

If you&amp;rsquo;ve made a new info product, instead of just tweeting out it&amp;rsquo;s link, you can create some artificial scarcity and tweet out &amp;ldquo;i made this. if you want it, just reply with a ðŸ‘‹ and i&amp;rsquo;ll personally DM it to you.&amp;rdquo;
This is known to get way more engagement and traffic.</description></item></channel></rss>
